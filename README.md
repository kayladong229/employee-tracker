# employee-tracker
Completed homework for the Module 12 Challenge. The purpose was to create a command-line application that used Node.js, MySQL, and Inquirer to manage a company database. This includes actions such as adding new departments or employees or even changing an employee's current role.

A video tutorial has also been created for this application which is linked below.
